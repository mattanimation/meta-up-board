Yocto BSP meta layer for the UP Xtreme
======================================

**Note: This branch for Yocto 'warrior' currently supports UP Xtreme only. For
all other UP products, please refer to the 'sumo' branch in this repository.**

This README file contains information on building the meta-up-board BSP
layer.  Please see the corresponding sections below for details.

For more information on the UP board see:

Building your Yocto image for each UP machine
=============================================

UP Xtreme:
--------------------
From the poky directory:

```
TEMPLATECONF=meta-up-board/conf source oe-init-build-env
MACHINE=up-xtreme bitbake upboard-image-sato
```

At the end of a successfull build, you should have a live image that
you can boot from a USB flash drive (see instructions on how to do
that below, in the section 'Booting the live USB image').


Booting the live USB image
==============================

This BSP creates bootable live images, which can be used to directly
boot Yocto off of a USB flash drive.  Upon completion of a successful
build, described in the previous section, the images are created in
a sub-folder named ./tmp/deploy/images/up-xtreme/

Under Linux, insert a USB flash drive.  Assuming the USB flash drive
takes device /dev/sdf, use dd to copy the live image to it.  For
example:

```
dd if=upboard-image-sato-up-xtreme.hddimg of=/dev/sdf
sync
eject /dev/sdf
```

This should give you a bootable USB flash device.  Insert the device
into a bootable USB socket on the target, and power on.  At the
initial BIOS splash screen, press F7 to display a menu of boot options
and select the USB device.  This should result in a system booted to
the Sato graphical desktop.

If you want a terminal, use the arrows at the top of the UI to move to
different pages of available applications, one of which is named
'Terminal'.  Clicking that should give you a root terminal.

If you want to ssh into the system, you can use the root terminal to
ifconfig the IP address and use that to ssh in.  The root password is
empty, so to log in type 'root' for the user name and hit 'Enter' at
the Password prompt: and you should be in.

If you find you're getting corrupt images on the USB (it doesn't show
the syslinux boot: prompt, or the boot: prompt contains strange
characters), try doing this first:

```
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdf bs=1M count=512
```
